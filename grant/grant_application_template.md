# Darwinia Grant Template

## Project name

### Project Description

•	A brief description of the project.

The solar power industry faces a shortfall of skilled technicians despite growing installations. This gap causes system downtime and losses as companies stretch their workforce thin. This problem has been confirmed by our interviews with leading companies from the sector and experienced first hand by our engineer colleague, Alexandru.
Our project revolutionizes solar panel maintenance through an advanced Augmented Reality (AR) platform, specifically designed for use with Microsoft HoloLens. This software guides technicians through precise, step-by-step repair and maintenance procedures, leveraging AR overlays and remote expert assistance to ensure tasks are executed efficiently and accurately. Complementing this technical solution, our platform introduces a pioneering NFT rewards system to track and incentivize employee KPI-s. 
We further extend the project's impact by integrating a comprehensive hub that supports DeFi including a marketplace and crowdfunding for new solar projects, facilitating community investment and participation in renewable energy initiatives.
Additionally, our platform serves as an educational hub, offering resources on Web3 and AR technologies to empower individuals with the skills needed for the emerging digital economy.  


•	An indication of why this project is good for the Darwinia ecosystem.

Our project's integration with the Darwinia Network is strategically designed to increase the strength and expand the reach of the network. By leveraging the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology alongside a web3 hub, we aim to drive adoption and engagement within the  ecosystem. The utilization of NFTs and blockchain-based tokens as tools for supervising and incentivizing employees has, based on our research and interviews with industry leaders, shown great promise in enhancing productivity and motivation. This system is expected to attract a considerable volume of transactions and interactions to the  network, thereby increasing its visibility and utility across a wider audience.
Moreover, the development of our photovoltaic hub, crafted with user-friendliness of Web2 interfaces while operating on the advanced and decentralized Web3 framework provided by the your network, will also increase the number of wallets on the network. This deliberate design choice is aimed at easing the transition for users unfamiliar with blockchain technologies, thereby encouraging mass adoption.
Our strategy extends to a comprehensive adoption plan, which we want to develop and discuss together, to ensure that users not only familiarize themselves with the platform and network but also integrate both into their daily routines seamlessly.

•	An indication of how you will integrate this project into Darwinia.

We have a plan to reward the engineers, as a commission based on KPI’s decided by our product, trough a native token of yours/ an NFT.

This way, we are bringing awereness of the project and also enterprise adoption to Darwinia ! We believe this successful implementation will adopt a lot of new retail and have a positive impact on Darwinia. Because of receving them as a commission, they will surely be open to test the system, per our discussion from this morning. Also, the managers are accepting the idea because we create them an internal way of tracking and rewarding the employees.

Also, on our Hub we can create educational content and present the people the opportunities they can have trough Darwinia. We were planning to have weekly webinars and can introduce sections about the ecosystem and educate the people.

Moreover, we are offering in the future to secure the network by running a node on Darwinia and being part of the community. 

We really think that together we can make a plan for integrating the Darwinia successfully and making a change in the renewable energy ecosystem. We would like to leverage our expertise in web3 development and in the energy sector and really succeed together !

### Additional Information

We are participating in an accelerator Program right now, which helped us a lot in networking with relevant people in this domain. 
We are also implementing our sollution in the first solar park right now for one of the leading companies in Eastern-Europe. We also have price-agreements with other companies in Romania.
We are discussing with leading-companies in the solar energy landscape about introducing web3 functionalities our product and implement it with them, facilitating enterprise adoption.
We have conducted numerous interviews and leveraging our expertise in the renewable energy landscape to validate our idea. We are sure that there is a need for a photovoltaic hub after conducting this intervies. Also, the maintenance companies are going to really benfit from our AR sollution.
